# SORTING VISUALIZER

Using P5.js I have implemented different algorithms SELECTION SORT , BUBBLE SORT , INSERTION SORT , SHELL SORT , ODD EVEN SORT , COMB SORT 
and CYCLE SORT. Each BAR in the sketch area represents a value , BIGGER the BAR BIGGER the value. The values are being arranged in ASCENDING 
order. Simply select the ALGORITHM and use VISUALIZE to see its working. Use RESET to reset the values i.e. generate random values in random
order.
